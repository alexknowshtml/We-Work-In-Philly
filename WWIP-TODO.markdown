1. Make repository public.  Need to permanently sanitize some information.
2. Widget has syntax error
3. Widget updated with new aesthetic
4. Categories implemented
5. Maps should be setup correctly as a resource with appropriate rails routes
6. Mapfeed is generated manually via json, should just be using Company.as_json method (probably)
