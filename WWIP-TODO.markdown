# TODO: General
1. Make repository public.  Need to permanently sanitize some information.
2. Widget has syntax error
3. Widget updated with new aesthetic
4. Categories implemented
5. Maps should be setup correctly as a resource with appropriate rails routes
6. Mapfeed is generated manually via json, should just be using Company.as_json method (probably)
7. 301 redirect for www and non-www
